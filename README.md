# NMS-RC1

This is an archive of the files taken from the PSARCs in No Man's Sky RC1 for PS4.

It does not include the `/AUDIO` or `/TEXTURES` folders, nor does it include the precompiled Orbis shaders in `/SHADERS/CODE/BIN/ORBIS`. Check the pins in #e3 in the NMS Retro Discord for the full psarc zip.

If all goes well, it may also one day hold the .eXmls for each MBIN.

Warning: If you download this, you will get an extra ~750mb of .git folder. This repository is intented as a quick reference. If you plan to work with these files for more than a few hours, you may be better off grabbing and extracting the PSARC zip previously mentioned.
