# NMS-RC1

This is an archive of the files taken from the PSARCs in No Man's Sky RC1 for PS4.

It does not include the `/AUDIO` or `/TEXTURES` folders, nor does it include the precompiled Orbis shaders in `/SHADERS/CODE/BIN/ORBIS`. Check the pins in #e3 in the NMS Retro Discord for the full psarc zip.

If all goes well, it may also one day hold the .eXmls for each MBIN.
